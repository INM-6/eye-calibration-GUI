Release Notes for c3d_load files for MATLAB

v2.14 (November 29, 2012)
Fixed an issue with using pre-Dexterit-E 3.1.0 data in KINARM_add_hand_kinematics

v2.13 (October 29 2012)
Fixed an issue with reading very long parameters.

v2.11 (October 31 2011)
KINARM_add_hand_Kinematics and KINARM_add_torques did not handle EP correctly (looked for certain KINARM parameters that 
	are part of calibration for Exo, but are part of xxxx_KINARM for EP).
One of those m-files also made that assumption that the right and left KINARMs were the same robot type.  That assumption is no longer made.

v2.10 (June 22 2011)
Added capability to zip_load to pass c3d filename options.

v2.9 (Jan 21 2011)
#565 - Fixing an issue calculating velocities
Added zip_load to load 3.0 format files.

c3d_load_(2009-09-14)
renamed LIMB_readC3D.m to c3d_load_single_file.m
Updated c3d_load_single_file.m to read new Events and Ranges section in c3d files, allowing up to 65535 events and 65535 ranges.
Updated c3d_load.m to move Ranges with a "Video Frame..." label into a new Video_Latency field.
added the following functions:
c3d_add_Video_Latency.m (this function adds minimum and maximum latencies for video display).
c3d_filter_dblpass.m (this function double pass filters all analog data)
demo_c3d_load.m (this function provides a basic demonstration of some of the features of the c3d_load files)
KINARM_add_hand_kinematics.m (this function adds hand speed and acceleration to the c3d data structure)

V2.7 (Feb 21 2009)
Fixed LIMB_readC3D.m to be able to read files with > 127 events (255 max now), and in general, with > 127 elements per dimension in any parameter's data (255 max).

V2.6 (Jan 26 2008)
Fixed LIMB_readC3D.m to files with no analog channels, just parameters.  Changed precision of fread from int16 to uint16 on POINT.FRAMES param
% to allow trials with > 32767 frames (up to 65535 frames now).

V2.5 (Feb 26 2008)
Fixed LIMB_readC3D.m to be able to handle parametergroup descriptions longer than 128 characters (up to 255 is now allowed)

V2.4 (Jan. 3, 2008)
Field names are now forced to be valid using genvarname

V2.1 to 2.3 (Aug. 2007)
Characters that are disallowed in fieldnames (e.g. -, /, [, ) etc…) are replaced with underscore to create valid fieldnames.
Parametergroups that do not have a separate DESCRIPTIONS parameter now get one created based on the descriptions of the individual parameters.

V2.0 (July 2007)
Re-organized structure of function calls to be more intuitive and user-friendly.
